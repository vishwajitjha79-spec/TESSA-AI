SINGLE IMAGE SETUP

You only need ONE image file!

Required file:
- avatar.png  (your T.E.S.S.A. image)

That's it! Just one image.

The app will use this same image for all moods.
The mood indicator will still show different emojis (😊, 🤔, etc.)
but the avatar image stays the same.

Recommended image specs:
- Format: PNG (with transparent or matching background)
- Size: 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels
- Clear facial expression

If the image is missing, the app will show a fallback emoji (🌌)
